# Dibas Pratap Basnet

AI/ML Engineer | Language Systems Enthusiast | Automation Architect

From streamlining NLP pipelines to crafting low-latency LLM tools, I work on problems at the intersection of language, data, and engineering efficiency. Currently shipping agentic ML systems, multilingual bots, and fast-response tools from Kathmandu.

## Purpose-Driven AI

I believe AI should empower people, not replace or exclude them.  
My work is guided by principles of **AI democratization**, **fair access**, and **ethical deployment**, particularly for communities that are often underrepresented in the tech landscape.

I'm passionate about:
- Localized NLP for under-resourced languages
- Human-centered design in AI tools
- Transparent model behavior and explainability
- Bridging infrastructure gaps with open, lean AI solutions
